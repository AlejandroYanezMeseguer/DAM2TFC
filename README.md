# VeilFire Requiem - (BETA)  

In a world on the brink of cataclysm, you play as a warrior destined to confront the eruption of the Tenebris Volcano, a threat many in your village dismiss as a “lie meant to control them.” Explore the Lands of Albion, face brutal enemies, and uncover the hidden truth behind despair and blind faith.

***Can you save Albion from the so-called volcano?***
